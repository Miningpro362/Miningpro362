Hey! I'm Nicky! I do random nonsense with computers, including code and mess around with linux.

I mainly use Javascript with Node.js 14.17.0, Lua in Computercraft, specifically CC:Tweaked, and also some HTML/CSS/JS stuff.

You can contact me at Miningpro362#8355 on discord, miningpro362@hmm.st on xmpp, @miningpro362:halogen.city on matrix ,Miningpro362 on Steam, and the same pretty much anywhere else I am!

If you wanna play games, dm me on discord or add me on steam, I'm down for it!

I'm an age regressor, and as such there might be some projects here that are made for/with in mind age regressors, their caregivers, and just generally the people who love them

I may also put stuff here for plural folk (people, and definitely for furries.

I also am a furry myself.
