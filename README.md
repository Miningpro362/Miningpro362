Hey! I'm Nicky! I do random bulls--t with computers, including code, d--k around with linux, and have my own ethereum private network.

I mainly use Javascript with Node.js 14.17.0, Lua in Computercraft, specifically CC:Tweaked, and also some HTML/CSS/JS stuff.

You can contact me at Miningpro362#4325 on discord, @miningpro362 on twitter, Miningpro362 on Steam, and the same pretty much anywhere else I am!

If you wanna play games, dm me on discord or add me on steam, I'm down for it!

I'm an age regressor, and as such there might be some projects here that are made for/with in mind age regressors, their cargivers, and just generally the people who love them

I may also put stuff here for systems (the collections of people that are due to personality disorders and the like), and definitely for furries.

I also am a furry myself.
